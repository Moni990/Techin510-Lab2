## Lessons Learned

- How to use  `pandas` library for loading and filtering the data. The code loads a dataset from a URL into a DataFrame, a table-like data structure. It demonstrates how to perform operations like filtering the DataFrame based on user inputs (e.g., selecting a range of bill lengths, choosing species, and selecting islands)
- How to integrate `plotly.express` for generating interactive data visualizations within a web application. 

## Questions / Uncertainties

 - How to customize the appearance (theme) of the Streamlit app?
 - What if I want to add interactive maps to visualize geographical data?
 - How to organize the app into multiple pages for better navigation and user experience?
